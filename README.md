# GitHub repository Terraform module

GitHub repository module which manages configuration and life-cycle
of all your GitHub repository configuration.

## Permissions

To manage the GitHub resources, provide a token from an account or a GitHub App with
appropriate permissions. It should have:

* Read access to `metadata`
* Read and write access to `administration`, `code`, and `secrets`

## Authentication

The GitHub provider requires a GitHub token or GitHub App installation in order to manage resources.

There are several ways to provide the required token:

* Set the `token` argument in the provider configuration. You can set the `token` argument in the provider configuration. Use an
input variable for the token.
* Set the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable. The provider can read the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable and the token stored there
to authenticate.

There are several ways to provide the required GitHub App installation:

* Set the `app_auth` argument in the provider configuration. You can set the app_auth argument with the id, installation_id and pem_file
in the provider configuration. The owner parameter is also required in this situation.
* Set the `GITHUB_APP_ID`, `GITHUB_APP_INSTALLATION_ID` and `GITHUB_APP_PEM_FILE` environment variables. The provider can read the GITHUB_APP_ID,
GITHUB_APP_INSTALLATION_ID and GITHUB_APP_PEM_FILE environment variables to authenticate.

> Because strings with new lines is not support:</br>
> use "\\\n" within the `pem_file` argument to replace new line</br>
> use "\n" within the `GITHUB_APP_PEM_FILE` environment variables to replace new line</br>

## Features

* Create and manage repositories within your GitHub organization or personal account.
* Configure branch protection for repositories in your organization or personal account.
* Create and manage GitHub Actions secrets within your GitHub repositories.
* Enable and manage GitHub Actions permissions for your GitHub repository.
* Create and manage branches within your repository.
* create and manage files within a GitHub repository.

## Usage example

```hcl
module "repository" {
  source  = "app.terraform.io/ConseilsTI/repository/github"
  version = "0.0.0"

  name               = "Repository Name"
  destination_type   = "This is a description for the GitHub repository."
  branch_protections = [
    {
      pattern                         = "main"
      enforce_admins                  = true
      require_conversation_resolution = true
      required_pull_request_reviews = {
        dismiss_stale_reviews           = true
        require_code_owner_reviews      = true
        required_approving_review_count = "1"
      }
    }
  ]
  actions_secrets = [
    {
      secret_name     = "Secret Name"
      plaintext_value = "Secret Value"
    }
  ]
  allowed_actions = "selected"
  allowed_actions_config = {
    github_owned_allowed = true
    patterns_allowed     = ["terraform-docs/gh-actions@*", "hashicorp/*"]
  }
  files = [
    {
      file    = "README.md"
      content = "# README"
    }
